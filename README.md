# Five Development Planes

### Strategy Development Planes

Here is how I broke down the strategy development plane for Identity Clothing:

1. Users/ Members
  * Users (Not Signed Up)
  * Members (Signed In)

2. Demographic/ Target Audience
  * Aged 16+
  * UK Based Customers
  * Men looking for Hoodies, T-Shirts or Shorts 
  * Women looking for Hoodies, T-Shirts or Shorts
  * Clothing Items on Sale

3. The website will need to enable the user to:
  * Sign up for an account
  * Find and View clothing items on the website
  * Find and View clothing items currently on sale on the website
  * View most popular clothing items
  * Search for clothing items
  * Contact the developer

4. The website will need to enable the member to:
  * Sign into their account
  * Find and View clothing items on the website
  * Find and View clothing items currently on sale on the website
  * View most popular clothing items
  * Search for clothing items
  * Add and Edit product reviews (if user only)
  * Save and Update personal and delivery information
  * View order history
  * Contact the developer

With the above strategy options for users and members in mind, I have created a User and Member strategy table (below) to show the importance and viability/ feasibility for all of the following opportunities/ problems:

## User Strategy Table

### Surface Development Plane

Colors Used

![Colors Used]()

Typography

The primary font used with BP Workout Plans was "Cabin". I wanted the font to match well with the UI of the website with its simplicity but was also very easy to read and understand.

The secondary font used was "Sans-Serif" which would display if the primary font was not able to load onto the user/ members device.

Images/ Screenshots

The images/ screenshots used within my Identity Clothing project were created using Figma and Paint. I also used Vimeo to screen record my testing videos within my TESTING.md file. There is also a separate IMAGES.md file where all of the image links are listed for all images used within my Identity Clothing project.

# Project Features

Jinja templating was used to extend the base.html template across every page for Identity Clothing. This is to keep the consistency and functionality of each page that extends the base.html template. The sections within the base.html template that are implemented for each page are:

The Navigation Bar (Both User & Member Navigation Bars)
The Burger Menu - Used to display the Navigation Links on Tablet and Mobile Devices
The Footer Section - Includes social links
Django Toast - Used to display toast messages got alerts, warnings, success & errors to let a user/ member know an action they have completed with a message box. (e.g: Success message for signing into your acccount)
Also includes all Bootstrap CSS & JS links & CDNs. Include javscript script tags for JS elements across all pages.

Base Template Example

Here is an example of the base.html template for the Home Page. At the top of the page {% extends "base.html" %} is used to display the content from the base.html as well as {% load static %} to load the CSS file. The Navigation Bar, Burger Menu, Footer Section and Django Toasts are used within all pages for this project. The {% block content %} is then used to display the content from each page between the Navigation Bar, Burger Menu & Footer Section.

# Features To Implement In The Future

1. Add Kids Clothing and Footwear Products

* To add a kids page to display clothing items for kids and footwear page to display footwear for men, women and kids.

2. Add product stock and out of stock options

* This will be displayed in the product detail page and display the amount of stock that is available for that product. There will be a stock option for each product size and notify the user if that product size is out of stock

3. Page Pagination

* This will paginate each page within the website when a certain amount of products are displayed. I will set it to only 9 products to be displayed per page so the page does not display all products and therefore decrease scroll time and length.

4. Allow availability and delivery internationally

* To widen the spread of the Identity Clothing website, we can deliver or post orders across the world to raise brand awareness and allow everyone to have access to Identity Clothing products/ Items. This can be introduced by adding VAT & a postage/ delivery fee for customers who are out of the UK depending on distance.

5. To Sell More Products and Add More Products For Each Category

* To add more product categories including coats, jeans, pyjamas, socks and underwear. To also increase the amount of products per category, there are 12 products per category at the moment. I would like to increase this to 25 products per category to have more clothing options and items.

[Back to Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

# Issues And Bugs

I ran into some issues during the development of Identity Clothing. The most notable issues or bugs are listed below along with a solution or how I fixed that issue.

1. Page Pagination

I tried to add page pagination to my product pages so they would only display a certain amount of products per page. This would have been used for the following pages
  * Search Page
  * Men's Products Page
  * Women's Products Page
  * Items on Sale Page
  * All Products Page

After implementing this into my project, there was an error when moving from page to page as the Men's & Women's product pages are based on the all products view. This would mean when clicking onto the next page of products, it would take the user to the all products page instead of the next page for the products they have quered or categorised for.

A solution to this is to separate each category into its own page, therefore when paginating through products, the pagination stays within the current category or search query and displays the correct amount of products on each page and the actual products displaying are relevant to the category or search query.

2. Toast JS

I ran into an issue with the toast messages displaying throughout my project. The JS code from the Boutique Ado project was not displaying the toast messages for any pages throughout my project.

To fix this I had to add some additional code which can be found below that fixed this issue.

![Toast Messages Javascript]()

3. Signals File For Products

There was an issue with the Product Review functionality, once a user adds a product review to a product, there needed to be an average rating for that product to display to other users. 

This was a problem until a tutor recommended a signals.py file to calculate the average rating for each product after a product review has been added, updated or deleted from the database.

The signals.py file code and products page code to display the average rating can be found below.

![Signals.py File]()

4. Favicon

I have added a favicon to my project that displays within the GitPod Workspace server. However the favicon does not display on the Heroku App. I had contacted tutor support about this but we could not find a reason as to why it was not displaying on my Workspace server but not Heroku App.

The favicon is also added to my AWS S3 Bucket which made no difference.

5. GitPod Workspace crashes and JQuery CDN links

Throughout the development of Identity Clothing, there were many times where GitPod Workspaces would crash and not save any of the code I had implemented. Therefore there maybe times where code has been readded or a mix up of commits due to this.

There was also another error which was due to the JQuery CDN link that was not working. This affected my project as many elements that required the JQuery CDN link were not working as they should be. 

This was later fixed and the js elements were fixed. This issue did cause some setbacks as I had to wait for the CDN link to work again to see if the code I had added for each section were working and displaying as they should.

  * python3 manage.py migrate --plan
  * python3 manage.py migrate

6. You will then need to load the JSON data files that can be located within your fixture folders that host all of the data for different database models. This can be done with the following commands within the terminal

  * python3 manage.py loaddata category
  * python3 manage.py loaddata products
  * python3 manage.py faqs

7. A superuser will then need to be created so you have access to the Django Admin Page. This can be done with the following commands within the terminal.

  * python3 manage.py createsuperuser - Create a super user using a username, email and password
  * python3 manage.py runserver - To run the server locally
  * Open the server and after the url add admin/
  * You should then be taken to a login page for Django Administration - Login using the details you entered when creating the superuser and view your database.

After completing all of these steps, you should be able to run your project within your local development environment.

# Heroku App Deployment

Herku is a cloud application platform that supports many programming languages. As this project is using a server, application and database, the developer thought Heroku was the best app to deploy his project.

Before you can deploy your project to Heroku, you must complete the following steps to allow the Heroku app to work.

### Creating a Heroku App Account

You can do this by following the steps below:

1. Sign up for a heroku account
2. Select the 'New' button at the top right of the page
3. Select 'Create New App' and give it a unique app name
4. Then Select 'Create App'
5. Select the 'Deploy' Tab and click 'Connect To GitHub'
6. Finally search for your GitHub repository name, select the correct repository and click 'Connect'

### Configure Heroku Variables

Within your Heroku dashboard, select 'Settings' and 'Reveal Config Vars' button to add all of the necessary variables for your project.

|Key|Values|
|:-----:|:-----:|
|AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID|<AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID>|
|AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY|<AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY>|
|DATABASE_URL|<DATABASE_URL>|
|EMAIL_HOST_PASS|<EMAIL_HOST_PASS>|
|EMAIL_HOST_USER|<EMAIL_HOST_USER>|
|SECRET_KEY|<SECRET_KEY>|
|STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY|<STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY>|
|STRIPE_SECRET_KEY|<STRIPE_SECRET_KEY>|
|STRIPE_WH_SECRET|<STRIPE_WH_SECRET>|
|USE_AWS|True|

* Navigate back to the 'Deploy' navaigation link
* Within the 'Automatic Deploys' section make sure that your main branch is selected and click on 'Enable Automatic Deploys'

### Configure Database

1. Freeze new dependancies by typing the following command line - pip3 freeze > requirements.txt
2. Create a Procfile so Heroku knows what file to run, you can do this with the following command line - echo web: python3 app.py > Procfile
3. Push both new files to GitHub. You can do this with the following commands
  * git add -A
  * git commit -m "Created requirements.txt and Procfile"
  * git push
4. Within the settings.py file. Add the following code 'import dj_database_url' to the top of the file
5. Find the DATABASE variable and replace with the following code:

  if 'DATABASE_URL' in os.environ:
    DATABASES = {
          'default': dj_database_url.parse(os.environ.get('DATABASE_URL'))
      }
  else:
      DATABASES = {
          'default': {
              'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
              'NAME': BASE_DIR / 'db.sqlite3',
          }
      }
      
6. Login into heroku within the terminal with the following command line
  * heroku login -i
  * login with your heroku details

7. Migrate models to Heroku. This can be done with the following command line
  * python3 manage.py makemigrations --dry-plan
  * python3 manage.py makemigrations
  * python3 manage.py migrate --plan
  * python3 manage.py migrate

8. Create a new superuser for the Heroku App

9. Temporarily disable 'COLLECTSTATIC' to prevent Heroku from collecting static files before setting up AWS. You can do this with the following command line
  * heroku config:set DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC=1 --app <your app name>
 
10. Add Heroku App the 'ALLOWED HOSTS' variable within the settings.py file.
  * ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['127.0.0.1', '<your_app_name>', 'localhost']
 
11. Commit these changes to GitHub.  You can do this with the following commands
  * git add -A
  * git commit -m "Commit Message"
  * git push
 
12. Set up a push to Heroku. You can do this with the following commands
  * Heroku git: remote -a <your_app_name>
 
13. Push to Heroku App
  * git push heroku main
