# Five Development Planes

### Strategy Development Planes

Here is how I broke down the strategy development plane for Identity Clothing:

1. Users/ Members
  * Users (Not Signed Up)
  * Members (Signed In)

2. Demographic/ Target Audience
  * Aged 16+
  * UK Based Customers
  * Men looking for Hoodies, T-Shirts or Shorts 
  * Women looking for Hoodies, T-Shirts or Shorts
  * Clothing Items on Sale

3. The website will need to enable the user to:
  * Sign up for an account
  * Find and View clothing items on the website
  * Find and View clothing items currently on sale on the website
  * View most popular clothing items
  * Search for clothing items
  * Contact the developer

4. The website will need to enable the member to:
  * Sign into their account
  * Find and View clothing items on the website
  * Find and View clothing items currently on sale on the website
  * View most popular clothing items
  * Search for clothing items
  * Add and Edit product reviews (if user only)
  * Save and Update personal and delivery information
  * View order history
  * Contact the developer

With the above strategy options for users and members in mind, I have created a User and Member strategy table (below) to show the importance and viability/ feasibility for all of the following opportunities/ problems:

### Surface Development Plane

Colors Used

![Colors Used]()

Typography

The primary font used with BP Workout Plans was "Cabin". I wanted the font to match well with the UI of the website with its simplicity but was also very easy to read and understand.

The secondary font used was "Sans-Serif" which would display if the primary font was not able to load onto the user/ members device.

Images/ Screenshots

The images/ screenshots used within my Identity Clothing project were created using Figma and Paint. I also used Vimeo to screen record my testing videos within my TESTING.md file. There is also a separate IMAGES.md file where all of the image links are listed for all images used within my Identity Clothing project.

# Project Features

Jinja templating was used to extend the base.html template across every page for Identity Clothing. This is to keep the consistency and functionality of each page that extends the base.html template. The sections within the base.html template that are implemented for each page are:

The Navigation Bar (Both User & Member Navigation Bars)
The Burger Menu - Used to display the Navigation Links on Tablet and Mobile Devices
The Footer Section - Includes social links
Django Toast - Used to display toast messages got alerts, warnings, success & errors to let a user/ member know an action they have completed with a message box. (e.g: Success message for signing into your acccount)
Also includes all Bootstrap CSS & JS links & CDNs. Include javscript script tags for JS elements across all pages.

Base Template Example

Here is an example of the base.html template for the Home Page. At the top of the page {% extends "base.html" %} is used to display the content from the base.html as well as {% load static %} to load the CSS file. The Navigation Bar, Burger Menu, Footer Section and Django Toasts are used within all pages for this project. The {% block content %} is then used to display the content from each page between the Navigation Bar, Burger Menu & Footer Section.
