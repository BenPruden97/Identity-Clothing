# Five Development Planes

### Strategy Development Planes

Here is how I broke down the strategy development plane for Identity Clothing:

1. Users/ Members
  * Users (Not Signed Up)
  * Members (Signed In)

2. Demographic/ Target Audience
  * Aged 16+
  * UK Based Customers
  * Men looking for Hoodies, T-Shirts or Shorts 
  * Women looking for Hoodies, T-Shirts or Shorts
  * Clothing Items on Sale

3. The website will need to enable the user to:
  * Sign up for an account
  * Find and View clothing items on the website
  * Find and View clothing items currently on sale on the website
  * View most popular clothing items
  * Search for clothing items
  * Contact the developer

4. The website will need to enable the member to:
  * Sign into their account
  * Find and View clothing items on the website
  * Find and View clothing items currently on sale on the website
  * View most popular clothing items
  * Search for clothing items
  * Add and Edit product reviews (if user only)
  * Save and Update personal and delivery information
  * View order history
  * Contact the developer

With the above strategy options for users and members in mind, I have created a User and Member strategy table (below) to show the importance and viability/ feasibility for all of the following opportunities/ problems:

### Surface Development Plane

Colors Used

![Colors Used]()

Typography

The primary font used with BP Workout Plans was "Cabin". I wanted the font to match well with the UI of the website with its simplicity but was also very easy to read and understand.

The secondary font used was "Sans-Serif" which would display if the primary font was not able to load onto the user/ members device.

Images/ Screenshots

The images/ screenshots used within my Identity Clothing project were created using Figma and Paint. I also used Vimeo to screen record my testing videos within my TESTING.md file. There is also a separate IMAGES.md file where all of the image links are listed for all images used within my Identity Clothing project.
