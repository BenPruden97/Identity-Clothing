# Testing Code Validation

### HTML Validation

Common errors/ warnings for all pages
  * Javascript tags - This was because of the Toast Messages JS to display for all pages
  * Empty Heading tags for <h5> - This was because of the average rating star icons to display the average rating for each product
  * Search Page - Stray end div tags from line 401 & 403. I was not able to located the stray end divs.
  * Contact Page - Accordion error. This was due to the FAQ looping for each accordion header and body templating
  * Sign Up Page - End Tag for body on line 497. Also an unclosed div element on line 261. both of these errors could not be found.
 
 Apart from these errors/ warnings listed. All pages passed the validation.
