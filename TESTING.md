# Testing Code Validation

### HTML Validation

Common errors/ warnings for all pages
  * Javascript tags - This was because of the Toast Messages JS to display for all pages
  * Empty Heading tags for <h5> - This was because of the average rating star icons to display the average rating for each product
  * Search Page - Stray end div tags from line 401 & 403. I was not able to located the stray end divs.
  * Contact Page - Accordion error. This was due to the FAQ looping for each accordion header and body templating
  * Sign Up Page - End Tag for body on line 497. Also an unclosed div element on line 261. both of these errors could not be found.
 
 Apart from these errors/ warnings listed. All pages passed the validation.

### CSS Validation

I used [W3C CSS Validation Service](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) to validate my CSS style sheet.

### JSHint Validation
 
JSHint was used to validation the Javascript across my project. The errors are listed below:
  * EmailJS & Swal - These are unused variables that are used for a success or error message after the user submits a contact form.
  * SwiperJS - This is an unused variable for the home page carousel that loops through products to display the most popular items.
  * Stripe - This is an unused variable for the stripe_elements.js file for Stripe Payments.
 
### Flake8 Validation
 
Some of the common errors for flake8 validation are listed below:
  * Lines too long - I updated most of the lines of code that were too long. There were some lines that could not be shortened.
  * Class has no object member - This was not needed
  * Variables not being used - Those variables were needed to view data within templates for looping and displaying content

Common Issues to note:

  * This issues is for the amount of images on a page and the format. The HTTP/2 requires additional support for functionality.

Bootstrap CSS & JS Links & Unused JS which is from Toast Messages
  * This issue is mostly on mobile devices and is from the Bootstrap CSS & JS Links.
  * The unused JS is also from the toast message & back to top button js for all pages. Both of these issues could not be changed.

Due to the quantity input and links
  * This issue is for the quantity input field and decrement, increment buttons and their ARIA IDs. This could not be changed.
  
Due to the select image input
  * This issue is for the image input field to add an image to a product. This could not be changed.
